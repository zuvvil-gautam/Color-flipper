# Color-flipper
<p>Color flipper project comes with basic javascript functionalities known as DOM .</p> 
<p>With the help of DOM(Document Object Model) i'm able to play around with the colors. On my every click, new color is displayed.</p>

<p>First tab is the Simple page where you'll have limited colors to play around.</p>
